Distributed File System is a set of client and server services that allow a large enterprise to organize many distributed SMB file shares into a distributed file system. DFS provides location transparency and redundancy to improve data availability in the face of failure or heavy load by allowing shares in multiple different locations to be logically grouped under one folder, or DFS root. <br /><br />
To configure DFS from the Web Access Tool, navigate to Shared Folder/DFS.  Click Change Settings.  Enable DFS.  Select whether or not to allow multiple DFS links on the root.  If selected, up to 8 DFS links may be shared on the root.<br /><br />
In DFS Link, click Change Settings.  Enter the DFS root folder name and click Save.  Click Add Link.
