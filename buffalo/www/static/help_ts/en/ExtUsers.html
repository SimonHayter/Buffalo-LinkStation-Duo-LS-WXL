You may allow users from a remote TeraStation to access your TeraStation's shares.  In the remote TeraStation, enable SMB in [Network/Network Services].  Then, in your TeraStation, enable [Delegate Authority to External SMB Server] in Network/Workgroup/Domain. Users from the remote TeraStation will then be able to access shares on your TeraStation.  Authentication will then be handled by the external server, and permissions for users and groups will be assigned through the remote TeraStation's Web Admin Tool.<br />
