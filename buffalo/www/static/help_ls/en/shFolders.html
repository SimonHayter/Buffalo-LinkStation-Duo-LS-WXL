<ul>
<li>"Windows": share will be SMB compatible, for use with Windows or Mac OS X computers.</li>
<li>"Apple": share will be AFP (AppleTalk) compatible, for use with older Mac OS 9 and earlier Apple computers.</li>
<li>FTP: allows access to the share via FTP.  To use, also enable FTP Server in Network Sharing Services.</li>
<li>Backup: allows the share to be used as backup destination by other TeraStations.</li>

If enabled, deleted files from the shared folder will be moved to a [Recycle Bin] folder rather than permanently deleted. <br />
<br />
Notes on Recycle Bin:
-Directory information is kept when a file is moved to [Recycle Bin].<br />
-A [Recycle Bin] folder can be set for each shared folder on the TeraStation or attached USB hard drive.<br />
-To use Recycle Bin on an attached USB hard disk, the disk format must be EXT3 or XFS.  Recycle Bin doesn't support FAT32 or NTFS.<br />
-Recycle Bin cannot be used with AFP (AppleTalk) or FTP.<br />

<div id="divHelpItem" class="doc" >
<div id="divDocumentTitle">Access Restrictions</div>
<div id="divDocumentText" class="doc_text">
By default, access restrictions are disabled.  This means that anyone on the local subnet can use the TeraStation.  To restrict TeraStation access to registered uses, check [Access Restrictions].<br />
<br />
Click [Add User/Group].  Put a check next to each user and groups that you want to have the right to access the restricted share.  Click [Add].  The user or group now has read-only access to the share.  To add write-access, double-click on [Read Only] and choose [Read and Write].  Click [Save] when done.<br />
<br />

Notes:
-If a user has both 'Read and Write' and 'Read Only' access, then they will have 'Read Only' access.  The more restrictive access will supercede.<br />
-A USB hard disk which is formatted with FAT16/32 is writable only by the backup utility.  If used as a shared folder, FAT16 and FAT32 drives will always be Read Only.<br />
-Attributes and settings of a shared folder outweigh and override attributes and privileges of users and groups.<br />
-If connecting via AppleTalk or FTP, then only individually assigned user access rights apply.  Group privileges alone will not be sufficient to access the share.
