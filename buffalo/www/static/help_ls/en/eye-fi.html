After configuring Eye-Fi on the LinkStation, all files on the Eye-Fi card will be copied to the selected folder on the LinkStation automatically.  If you change the distination folder for some types of files in an Eye-Fi manager in another device (such as your computer), and then go back into the LinkStation's Eye-Fi interface to make further changes, you'll get a "Multiple Destinations" message.  Choose [Partial Transfer] to leave the multiple destination settings in place, or [Full Transfer] to reconfigure the Eye-Fi card to transfer all files, regardless of type, to the selected share on the LinkStation.
