<div id="divDocumentText" class="doc_text">
Using BuffaloNAS.com is an easy way to give people access to your shared folders. BuffaloNAS.com merely acts as a referral Web page, connecting your friends, family and co-workers with your LinkStation. BuffaloNAS.com does not store, save or access any of your data at any time. 
</div>

<div id="divDocumentTitle">BuffaloNAS.com Name</div>
<div id="divDocumentText" class="doc_text">
This is the name that you want to assign to your LinkStation and give to your friends. They will access your LinkStation under BuffaloNAS.com using this name. The system at BuffaloNAS.com will check if your name is already in use and alert you to select an alternative name if your choice is already taken. Please, be patient and do not select common names, such as "mylinkstation" or "ourfiles".

<div id="divDocumentTitle">BuffaloNAS.com Key</div>

<div id="divHelpItem" class="doc" >
<div id="divDocumentTitle">Auto-Configure Firewall (UPnP)</div>
<div id="divDocumentText" class="doc_text">
This will set up the firewall ports on your router automatically for external Web Access to your LinkStation. Note that your router needs to support UPnP for this feature to work. If your router does not support UPnP, or if you have a complicated network, you can disable this feature and configure your firewall manually.
</div>
</div>

<br />

<div id="divHelpItem" class="doc" >
<div id="divDocumentTitle">External Port</div>
<div id="divDocumentText" class="doc_text">
This is the EXTERNAL port that your LinkStation will use for the Web Access interface. When manually forwarding through your firewall, this is the external port (Internet facing) that is forwarded to port 9000 on your LinkStation. You can enter any valid port from 1-65535. Please note that the LinkStation is always using port 9000 for internal access to the Web Access server.
