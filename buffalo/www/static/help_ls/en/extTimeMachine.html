To use the LinkStation as a location for backups from a Mac running Time Machine, begin by creating a folder for the backups.
<br />
<br />
Choose [Shared Folders] from the left-side menu.  In the main window, click [Add].
<br />
<br />
Name the folder.  Make sure that [Apple] is checked for Shared Folder Support.  Disable the Recycle Bin support.  Click [Apply].
<br />
<br />
Choose [Time Machine] from the left-side menu.  Enable Time Machine functionality.  For the Target folder, select the folder that you created for the backups.  Click [Apply].
<br />
<br />
Enter the Mac’s “Computer Name” from its sharing page as the [Target Host Name].  For the [Target MAC address], enter the Mac’s Ethernet ID from Advanced Settings in its Network Preferences page.  Click [Apply].
<br />
<br />
Wait seven minutes for the folder to be built.
<br />
<br />
On your Mac, in the Finder, click on [All] below [Shared].  Find your LinkStation in the window and double-click on it.  Close the Finder.
<br />
<br />
Turn on Time Machine.  Click on [Change Disk].  Chose your LinkStation from the list and click [Use for Backup].  Time Machine will begin running a backup in two minutes.
