Clicking [Erase] overwrites all data on the disk with zeros.  Erasing the TeraStation is recommended when you sell, donate, or give it away, or if you otherwise want to delete all data from the unit so that it can never be recovered.  This cannot be undone.  After erasing, all settings on the TeraStation are restored to their factory defaults.
